This movie was produced in France.

It was a movie that I happened to watch late at night because I couldn't sleep, but it came to me as an unexpected movie of my life.

I watched a movie to sleep, but I couldn't sleep more because the movie lingered in one`s mind.

It's a story about a special cohabitation that began with a two-week bet.

Philip, the top 1% millionaire who can't do anything without a 24-hour-a-day caregiver, and one day, all he has is a healthy body, the bottom 1% penniless unemployed Driss, who is curious and suggests a special bet.

He wants to be Philip's hands and feet for just two weeks to test whether he can endure nursing himself without falling apart.
The only patient as much as some of the most incredible who can't find Driss blurted out, brought in to accept a bet is to come.

Like this, the two extremes that seemed totally out of place,
It is a story about two men living together in unpredictable and wonderful ways.

A famous ambassador for this film,
